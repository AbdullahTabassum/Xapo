# Xapo

This project consists of the following frameworks:
	1. Room
	2. LiveData
	3. ViewModel
	4. Dagger2
	5. Retrofit

The APIs that this project connects to are:
	1. GitHub 

This Android application downloads popular Android GitHub repositories and persists them.
It allows a user to select a Repository from a list of repositories.

Things I would like to add to this project:
	1. paging - currently there is not paging support and i am pretty sure all of the repositories are not coming down from the service request
	2. image caching - picasso api
